"""local-weather-awareness entry point: one run of the static weather-page generator.

One run does, in order:

1. take the single-instance lock (a second copy started by the scheduler while a slow run
   is still going exits 0 with a log line instead of fighting over the output files) and arm
   the network budget (``http.begin_run``: once ``cfg.run_budget_s`` seconds are spent, or
   once a host has failed at the transport level, further requests fail at once and every
   source falls back to its last good copy, so a hanging upstream cannot stall the run),
2. fetch the active NWS alerts once and resolve the outlines of zone-based alerts,
3. fetch the latest MRMS radar frame once (it is shared by every site's maps), unless no
   site's map reaches the MRMS grid (the contiguous US): radar is then "not applicable",
4. unless ``WEATHER_ROADS=0``, and only when at least one site's map reaches New Mexico:
   fetch New Mexico's emergency road closures once (NMDOT's NMRoads feed) plus, unless
   ``WEATHER_LSR=0``, the NWS storm reports from New Mexico that name a closed or flooded
   road (``weather.roads``),
5. per site: point metadata, current conditions, the 7-day and hourly forecasts, sun and
   twilight times, the alerts AT / NEAR the site, the road closures and storm reports on its
   map, and one radar map per theme (alerts shaded, road closures drawn),
6. write ``index.html`` and ``status.json``.

Local times use the site's NWS time zone, or the static ``tz`` from the site config when
the ``/points`` metadata is unavailable (UTC only when neither is known). Nothing here
depends on which sites are configured: the alert query covers the states, territories and
marine areas on the sites' maps (``WEATHER_ALERT_AREAS=auto``; a site whose own state an
explicit list leaves out is reported), the road sources are skipped when no map reaches New
Mexico, and a map outside the MRMS grid (contiguous US) says that it can show no radar.

Every fetch and render step is guarded: a failing source becomes a "not ok" status dict on
the page plus a line in the run's error list, never a crash, because the scheduler (cron,
or a systemd timer) must keep publishing whatever is available. The exit code is 0 even
when every source is down; it is non-zero only for a configuration error or an unwritable
output or cache directory — the things a retry in five minutes will not fix. The run dict
also records the network budget / circuit-breaker state (``run["network"]``) so
status.json can name the cause.

Road closures are an overlay: a road source that is down, a road step that crashes, or a
renderer that fails while drawing them never costs a site its maps (the map is then drawn
again without the road layer) or the page.
